# SQL Joins Queries

This project demonstrates the use of different SQL joins on the Airbnb database.

## Queries
1. **INNER JOIN** – Retrieve all bookings with their respective users.
2. **LEFT JOIN** – Retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties with no reviews.
3. **FULL OUTER JOIN** – Retrieve all users and bookings, even if not linked.

## Files
- `joins_queries.sql`: Contains all SQL join queries.
# SQL Subqueries

This project demonstrates the use of correlated and non-correlated subqueries on the Airbnb database.

## Queries

1. **Non-correlated subquery** – Find all properties where the average rating is greater than 4.0.
2. **Correlated subquery** – Find all users who have made more than 3 bookings.

## File
- `subqueries.sql`: Contains all subquery SQL queries.
# SQL Aggregations and Window Functions

This project demonstrates the use of SQL aggregation and window functions to analyze Airbnb data.

## Queries

1. **Aggregation (COUNT + GROUP BY)** – Finds the total number of bookings made by each user.
2. **Window Function (RANK)** – Ranks properties based on the total number of bookings received.

## File
- `aggregations_and_window_functions.sql`: Contains all SQL queries for aggregation and ranking.
